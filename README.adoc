# JBoss BRMS/BPMSuite KIE Server (execution server) for OpenShift container image

This is an image example for both link:https://github.com/jboss-container-images/jboss-decisionserver-6-openshift-image[BRMS Decision Server 6 OpenShift container image]
and link:https://github.com/jboss-container-images/jboss-processserver-6-openshift-image[BPMSuite Process Server 6 OpenShift container image].
It is not currently released or supported as an independent image for end-users, but instead serves as a home for reusalbe RHDS and RHIPS KIE modules

NOTE: Extends "rhel7:7-released"


# JBoss 6.4.x RHDS and RHIPS Modules

Here are located all CeKit modules, all the modules that will be used to configure and build the images are placed here.
These modules are copied into the container at build time. There are also external dependencies, like jboss-eap-modules,
cct_modules, etc.; all **external** modules can be found on the modules section of the image.yaml file descriptor for each image.

Below, all CeKit modules contained in this repository:

## Tests

There are three different kind of tests: bats, arquillian and behave which are described in details in the next topics.


### Running Arquillian tests

The arquillian is a more complete test, which runs a end to end test: reads an application template, deploys it on an
OpenShift Cluster, completes some tasks, like fire rules, start process, etc. then stops the RHDM/PAM and clean up all
the resources created to run the tests (it is only available for bxms 6.4 yet).
All the needed details and info about how to run these tests are described [here](tests/arquillian/kieserver/64/README.md)
